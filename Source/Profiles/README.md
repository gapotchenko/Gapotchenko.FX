![Gapotchenko FX Profile](../../Documentation/Assets/gapotchenko-fx-profile-shrink.png?raw=true&v=2)

Instead of referencing each individual Gapotchenko.FX module, you can opt in into referencing a profile.

Technically, profile is a NuGet meta-package that contains the references to relevant modules.

## Available Profiles
